# Fusion Builder Sample Add-On
Fusion Builders sample add on for developers

This addon is based on Cordops blueprint for "Quotes Rotator" here - http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/QuotesRotator/

## Developer Documentation
You can access our developer documentation for Fusion Builder here - https://theme-fusion.com/support/documentation/fusion-builder-api-documentation/

## Shortcode Guidelines
Please note, you must start your shortcode using <strong>fusion_</strong> so FB will identify it as a part of FB elements.

So, for ex. you are creating a custom element for blog, then your shortcode should be like <strong><i>fusion_blog_shortcode</i></strong>
